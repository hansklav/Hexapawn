# Hexapawn
A self learning chess-like game: the simplest form of Artificial Intelligence.

It was Ken Thomsom, the programmer of the early versions of UNIX, who made me curious how to program a self-learning version of a simple game. In the (1st Edition UNIX Programmer's Manual (1971)) in section VI a "learning" Tic-Tac-Toe program by Ken is mentioned "that never makes the same mistake twice". He programmed it in DEC PDP-7 assembler and I had no idea how that could be done. Some time later I found a description and source code listing of the game Hexapawn in the first edition of "[101 BASIC Computer Games](https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_decBooks10Mar75_26006648/page/n121/mode/2up?view=theater)" (by DEC, 1975). Hexapawn was unknown to me but I was led to [a 1962 article by Martin Gardner](https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_decBooks10Mar75_26006648/page/n245/mode/2up) in the Mathematical Recreations columns of Scientific American.
