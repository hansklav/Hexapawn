# Hexapawn
A self learning chess-like game: the simplest form of Artificial Intelligence.

It was Ken Thomsom, the programmer of the early versions of UNIX, who made me curious how to program a self-learning version of a simple game. In the [1st Edition UNIX Programmer's Manual (1971)](https://web.archive.org/web/20060314022603/http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/1stEdman.html) in section VI (User-maintained software)
a "learning" Tic-Tac-Toe program by Ken is mentioned "that never makes the same mistake twice". He programmed it in DEC PDP-7 assembler and I had no idea how that could be done. Some time later I found a description and source code listing of the game Hexapawn in the first edition of "[101 BASIC Computer Games](https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_decBooks10Mar75_26006648/page/n121/mode/2up?view=theater)" (by DEC, 1975), stating that "The program learns by elimination of bad moves". This sparked my interest.

Hexapawn was unknown to me but I was led to [a 1962 article by Martin Gardner](http://cs.williams.edu/~freund/cs136-073/GardnerHexapawn.pdf) in the Mathematical Games columns of Scientific American. It describes a game played by human against machine with 6 chess pawns on a 3 x 3 board. Before a series of plays the machine has zero knowledge of playing-strategy, at first makes random moves and looses several times before learning how to play well. After ten to twenty plays (of at most 7 moves each) the machine invariably gets invincible. Martin Gardner's "machine" consists of 24 matchboxes, one for each possible state of the game, and filled with coloured beads, one for every legal move that can be made from this state. When a move immediately leads to defeat the bead with the colour that represents that move is taken away from that box, so that particular move will not be played again by the machine.

Later editions of "101 BASIC Computer Games", for instance used [here](https://github.com/coding-horror/basic-computer-games/tree/main/46_Hexapawn), have a Hexapawn BASIC implementation by R.A. Kaapke from 1976 with the whole game tree already "hard wired" into the source code (just like Martin Gardner's matchboxes machine). The original 1975 version of the BASIC program by Jeff Dalton is a bit more interesting in that it builds from scratch the in-memory database of all possible game states and legal moves from them. So I decided to use this code as a basis for my own implementation in Oberon-07.
