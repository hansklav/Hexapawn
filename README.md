# Hexapawn
A self learning chess-like game: the simplest form of Artificial Intelligence.

It was Ken Thomsom, the programmer of the early versions of UNIX, who made me curious how to program a self-learning version of a simple game. In the [1st Edition UNIX Programmer's Manual (1971)](https://web.archive.org/web/20060314022603/http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/1stEdman.html) in section VI (User-maintained software)
a "learning" Tic-Tac-Toe program by Ken is mentioned "that never makes the same mistake twice". He programmed it in DEC PDP-7 assembler and I had no idea how that could be done. Some time later I found a description and source code listing of the game Hexapawn in the first edition of "[101 BASIC Computer Games](https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_decBooks10Mar75_26006648/page/n121/mode/2up?view=theater)" (by DEC, 1975). 

Hexapawn was unknown to me but I was led to [a 1962 article by Martin Gardner](http://cs.williams.edu/~freund/cs136-073/GardnerHexapawn.pdf) in the Mathematical Games columns of Scientific American. It describes a game played by human against machine with 6 chess pawns on a 3 x 3 board. Before a series of plays the machine has zero knowledge of playing-strategy, at first makes random moves and looses several times before learning how to play well. After ten to twenty matches (of at most 7 moves) the machine invariably gets invincible.
